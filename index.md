### Research Experience

**Design and realization of intelligent guide dog(provincial level (e.g. government))**

Project Leader *Intelligent Multimedia Lab*

- Brief: Development of intelligent electronic guide dogs based on joint vision and radar obstacle avoidance, voice broadcasting and navigation. Detection of complex terrain and visual image recognition is realized through camera and LIDAR, combined with deep learning and signal processing technologies. The GPS/RTK navigation system is used to provide precise positioning, and the integrated voice announcement system provides real-time feedback for the blind.
- Innovation Points: Adopted new path planning and target detection algorithms, optimized pedestrian detection and small target obstacle detection; integrated and developed a multi-functional intelligent assistance system for visually impaired people to improve navigation safety and convenience.
- Contributions: Leading the design and development of target detection algorithms to dynamically and accurately recognize pedestrians and obstacles in complex scenarios; responsible for the integration and development to ensure the seamless connection of various modules; coordinating the project process as a team leader to efficiently promote the development progress and complete the tasks with high quality.

**Research and system development of methods for analyzing college students' physical fitness data**

Project Leader *Intelligent Multimedia Lab*

- Brief: Based on the research and system development of college students' physical fitness data analysis method, we aim to analyze college students' physical fitness test data in-depth, and provide comprehensive physical fitness assessment and development trend prediction for the education department and schools, so as to serve as a reference for policy and teaching plan development.
- Innovation Points: Deep learning algorithms are applied to cluster analysis of physical fitness data to realize the segmentation of student groups and the mining of different quality types, providing scientific basis for policy making and teaching plans. Innovation. Using anomaly detection algorithm to identify abnormal scores in physical fitness data, providing visual decision support for physical education teaching and management.
- Contributions: Leading the development of big data statistics and anomaly detection algorithms to ensure high accuracy and precise identification of data anomalies in grades, classes and individuals; responsible for the platform integration of the overall project to ensure the stable operation and efficient synergy of various technical modules; as the project team leader, strictly coordinating and managing the project process to ensure that the objectives of each stage are completed on time and with high quality.

### Hobby

- Singing: Participated in the school's Music Festival and Top Ten Singers Competition, as well as serving as a judge for the House Singing Competition. She showed her talent in the music festival and communicated with music lovers.
- Hosting: As the host captain of the college, she hosted the college's welcome party and also served as a judge for the college's hosting competition.
